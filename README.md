# An /r/cscareerquestions College Survival Guide

With our final school year beginning, we were reflecting on how lost and confused we were when we first started university. We made a lot of mistakes (still am) along the way, but we‚Äôre in a much better place after learning from them and constantly putting ourselves out there. In hopes of shining some light and helping others, we decided to make a comprehensive guide for university students ‚Äì based on our knowledge/experiences - on how to start your successful CS Career (or gain the wisdom to avoid CS altogether, more on this later).

/u/rishiss Background: I am a 4th year student at UC Irvine majoring in Software Engineering. I am an incoming Software Engineer at a F100 company (received return offer after interning this summer).  Before that, I interned at an R & D center for space, a small cloud company, and a small IT company. I have a 3.65 GPA, won a few awards at startup competitions/hackathons, and remain pretty active in my schools CS organizations. I began coding in high school taking an ‚ÄòIntro to CS‚Äô course.

/u/chaitu65c Background: I‚Äôm a 4th year student at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science. I‚Äôm currently a SWE Intern at a Unicorn and just wrapped up my 2nd internship at a Live Streaming Company(you can most likely tell who they are if you browse my history LOL). Before this, I interned at my school‚Äôs IT department, did research under a professor, and worked on a few small startups that other UCI students were building. I have a 3.3 GPA, won some awards along /u/rishiss and was pretty active in my school‚Äôs CS clubs. I also began coding in high school through an intro to CS course.

Disclaimer: ‚ÄúBut /u/rishiss/ and /u/chaitu65c, you don‚Äôt work at a Big N, go to a target CS school, why should I take your advice?‚Äù You‚Äôre absolutely right; we are, by no means, ‚Äòup there‚Äô like some other folks on this sub. And, you don‚Äôt have to take our advice! Simply close this tab and do whatever else you want üòä.
Our intent is to guide and prepare uni students for a CS career they enjoy, not work at Big N or get the highest TC. Life is much more than a dick-measuring contest, and the earlier you learn that the better.

[We have also created a guide with our own personal advice and stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QpbntzGn3DG64nYSE2Av9AlszZB2hqXWVdIqCSCj1qg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Please, take this advice with a grain of salt. we‚Äôre not Tony Robinson or Tim Apple, we‚Äôre just two random reddit users.

## Mindset/Balancing Life

#### *Success is an attitude.*

The most successful people we‚Äôve seen in CS are those invested in what they love to do. They‚Äôre willing to take on challenges optimistically. They don‚Äôt compare themselves to others, but instead gain inspiration from them. And, most importantly, they embrace failure and learn from their mistakes. These folks have something called a Growth Mindset (https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).

But, what does this have to do with CS? A lot. In your college career, you‚Äôre going to be bashing your head trying to debug your code, you‚Äôre going to get a project and have no idea where the fuck to even start, you‚Äôre going to compare yourself to that Google intern, hell, you may even think of changing majors and quitting CS altogether. If you want to be successful in CS, you‚Äôre going to have to be optimistic in finding a solution, you‚Äôre going to have to spend 4 hours RTFMing and browsing Stack Overflow, you‚Äôre going to ask that Google intern for advice, and you‚Äôre going to have to gain confidence with what you‚Äôre doing.

#### *We all start somewhere, and we all fail. Success is the attitude to get back up and push through, no matter where we came from.*

Moving away from the psychology/motivational mumbo jumbo, the other thing I‚Äôve noticed about successful CS kids at school is their great balance with their social, work, and school life. They definitely put in the time for homework, exams, etc, but also make sure to work out, occasionally drink with friends, and watch anime. They‚Äôre responsible adults; they don‚Äôt procrastinate on assignments, play League 24/7, and get high everyday. IMO, building a strong work ethic and leaving time to play will take you far.

## Is CS Right For Me?

#### *You'll never know until you try.*

The way we see it, there‚Äôs 3 types of people pursuing CS.

1. Those who know CS isn‚Äôt for them ‚Äì They‚Äôre in it for the money, to appease their parents, for a minor/requirement, some external factor. They hated programming while taking the introductory CS course and just try to get done with their class/degree ASAP.

**Advice**: The majority of people who fall under this usually burn out quickly as they aren‚Äôt motivated enough to learn the material and to apply themselves. This usually leads to them  cheating and getting kicked out. Before you even start this major, you should definitely understand that this isn‚Äôt going to be easy and you do have to put in a lot of effort to succeed. If this isn‚Äôt your cup of tea, definitely look into switching into another major you like.

2. Those who don‚Äôt know if CS is for them ‚Äì Where most of the CS community is IMO. These folks (like myself) are riddled with something called Imposter Syndrome: ‚Äúthe constant feeling of not being good enough or knowing enough to do your job well.‚Äù

**Advice**: Really take the time to learn and be open to anything you go through. A good sign that you should look for in continuing CS is when you complete a Data Structures course, usually one of the hardest courses out there. If you don‚Äôt understand anything no matter how hard you try, it‚Äôs definitely to switch majors/careers as you did it your best shot. But if you do understand and even enjoy it, you‚Äôre most likely gonna stick with CS at this point.

3. Those who know for a fact CS is for them ‚Äì The diamonds in the rough. Learning and practicing CS material gives them a euphoric high.

**Advice**: Learn to broaden your scope and learn new areas of CS! Who knows, you might find another new field that you really want to work in. Other than that, definitely make new friends regardless of whether they‚Äôre a CS major or not.

## Freshman Year

Don‚Äôt take more than 3-4 classes in your first quarter/semester. Attend your classes, of course, but make sure to keep ample amount of time to go to professional/social events and self-learning.

The biggest issue we see with freshmen (even upperclassmen) is their ignorance on all the avenues available in the CS Industry. So we‚Äôve tried to narrow it down (not exhaustive).

1. Cyber Security Engineer
2. Front-End Web Developer
3. Backend Web Developer
4. UI/UX Designer
5. DevOps/Cloud/Site-Reliability Engineers
6. Mobile Engineer
7. QA Engineer
8. Product Manager
9. Data Scientist (Machine Learning/AI)
10. Embedded Software Engineer
11. Systems Administrator
12. Database Administrator (The Wizards)
13. Networking Engineer
14. Hardware Engineer
15. OS Developer
16. Video Game Developer
17. Solutions Architect/Sales Engineer/Technical Account Manager

As a freshman, definitely take the time and see if you can picture yourself doing all fields. You should open yourself for all facets of CS and not just the ‚Äúhot field‚Äù like Data Science and Machine Learning. Choosing a field because it‚Äôs ‚Äúexciting‚Äù will usually lead to bad results as usually, other people are thinking just like you and will lead to oversaturation.

Our recommendation is to select the top 5 fields that have piqued your interest and experiment with the field. For example, if you were interested in Mobile App Development, try learning how to build an app from the ground up. This lets you understand what skills you would need for this field and can serve as a forecast as to what your career would look like.

You should definitely look for an internship. Ignore the people that tell you to wait until you‚Äôre a junior, as it‚Äôs going to be very hard to get an internship if you don‚Äôt have any experience. Common places that most students don‚Äôt realize are available are usually IT departments at your school and even research with professors. Researching is highly recommended as you can definitely learn more about a field you can be interested in and if you‚Äôre interested in graduate school, that‚Äôs going to be a letter of recommendation that you can ask for. 

If you‚Äôre considered a minority in Computer Science, look into first and second year internship programs as they‚Äôre meant to help you succeed. Here‚Äôs some programs that come to mind:

[Google STEP](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/)

[Microsoft Explore](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/870951/Internship-Opportunities-for-Students-Explore-Program)

[Amazon Future Engineer](https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/)

[Uber STARInternhip](https://www.uber.com/global/en/careers/list/62885/)

[Facebook University](https://www.facebook.com/careers/students-and-grads/students)

Another way to get internships is to research into smaller companies in your area. If the company is very small (<100 employees), consider reaching out to the CEO on LinkedIn. They might be able to help you! Also, take advantage of university recruiting websites like Handshake to see companies that directly hire from your school. 
As for understanding what you need to know to get an internship, look at the ‚ÄòSearching for an Internship‚Äô section.

## Sophomore Year

Now that you have basic programming knowledge, we highly recommend you start getting involved in your school‚Äôs/region‚Äôs CS community like ACM, WICS, hackathons (see ‚ÄòHackathon‚Äô section below) and more. If you weren‚Äôt able to find an internship/research opportunity as a freshman, this becomes especially important as projects and community involvement are a great way to make you stand out on your resume and to recruiters. And as you brush up on your skills, apply again and try your luck out. Nobody expects you to make a full-stack MERN project hosted and scaled on AWS. Focus instead on clean code, learning a framework or two on a language you like, and creating a small, robust feature. 

## Junior Year
It‚Äôs time to get some skin in the game. As a junior, companies are more willing to hire you for an internship, as they are likely to convert you into a full-time employee after graduating. This transition process is much easier than interviewing, and they'll usually offer you a higher compensation package if they want to convert you to a full-time employee. As you now should have knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms, we highly recommend looking into coding interview prep sites like LeetCode and HackerRank or purchasing a prep book like Cracking the Coding Interview or Elements of Programming Interview. 

## Senior Year
If you were able to get a return offer from an internship, congrats! However, don‚Äôt immediately sign the offer. Once you have an offer, you should still try to interview at companies that you‚Äôre interested in by the deadline of the time to accept the offer. A good way of doing this is to reach out to a University recruiter for that company and explain the deadline you have. Usually, they‚Äôre really helpful and can potentially help skip interviews that you were supposed to do!

In addition, if your friends were able to intern at places you‚Äôre interested in, you should definitely ask for a referral or to send your resume to the recruiter. This usually reduces the risk of being ghosted by that company and would increase your chances of getting hired!

Once you finally sign, definitely take the time to relax and enjoy as you‚Äôve basically entered second semester senior mode :D (Just make sure you pass your classes and stay out of trouble)

## Classes:


### *What Classes should I take?*

#### Should Already be Required (if these are not already included in your school‚Äôs curriculum, I‚Äôd think twice about attending that school):

Programming in Java/C++/Python (OOP): This is how you‚Äôre gonna start coding.

Boolean Algebra/Discrete Math: Teaches you some background knowledge to CS.

Data Structures and Algorithms: Teaches you some ways data is stored and retrieved. Very important as you‚Äôre going to be using them a lot.

Low Level Programming /C: Teaches you what coding used to be like in the old days. 

#### Must Take (While these classes may be optional in the curriculum, you will use the knowledge gained in these classes throughout your career)

**Computer Networks**: Highly recommended as it helps you understand Web protocols like REST, HTTP vs HTTPS, TCP vs UDP, etc.

**Operating Systems/UNIX**: Most important class. Teaches you important things such as the kernel, Threads vs Processes and Process Schedulers.

**Databases/SQL**: It‚Äôs very likely that your job as a software engineer will be to interact with databases. It‚Äôs really good to understand what they are before you enter the industry

**Programming Languages**: Teaches you trade offs between languages like C and Python. It definitely helps when you need to pick up brand new languages!

#### Good to Have

**Full-stack web dev** (pref MERN stack, our school offered both LAMP and MERN)

**Very deep understanding of at least one language.** (You‚Äôll be surprised to learn how many students who graduate fail to do this)
 
**Semester/Year-Long Capstone course (pref working with a company) if your school supports it:** an internship where you get credits instead of money.

**Compilers**: Teaches you how programming languages are implemented 'under the hood.'

**Human Computer Interaction**: If you weren‚Äôt able to learn Full-stack web dev

### How do I succeed in these classes?

/u/rishiss: You‚Äôre more than likely coughing up hundreds, if not thousands, to attend university. It makes no sense to not take full advantage of the course and course staff.

**Do the readings beforehand** ‚Äì Dr. K explains [how studying before class is an OP mechanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlk0NAA3I48), also highly recommend this video on [how to study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw4dMehQkgs) by him as well

**Attend EVERY lecture, sit at the front of the class** ‚Äì I‚Äôve seen a metric fuck ton of students in the back of the class with their laptops shopping, trading stocks, scrolling through Reddit, even watching lesbian hentai. By sitting in the front of the class, you‚Äôre forced to stay engaged (and close your porn tabs).

**Take notes on Google Docs** ‚Äì I‚Äôve heard a lot of people say taking notes with pen and paper is better for memory retention, health, w.e. But tbh, there are times where I can‚Äôt keep up with the prof or I want to enter my code into the IDE to see what happens. I  do a three way split; Google Docs on the left, IDE on top right and terminal (to compile, see output, make new file, etc) on bottom left. Make sure to note down the date and topic of the lecture. Write questions you have in comments. Highlight important information and possible test questions. Share the link with friends!

**Make a study guide, even though the professor does not give you one** ‚Äì Using my Google Docs notes, I compile the highlighted information into a summarized study guide. It‚Äôs a fantastic review tool. I‚Äôve even shared the study guide with professors/classmates and gotten their feedback and extra information.

**Go to office hours and become close with 1-2 professors** ‚Äì Some jobs and most masters/PHD programs require letters of recommendation. While you could get reccs from your work, its great to get a letter from someone in academia, especially if they‚Äôre established in the field you are pursuing. Get your ass to office hours and show professors that you are curious and motivated by asking questions about assignments, career, or even personal interests. They provide a cornucopia of opportunities, including research, letters of recc, or even the opportunity to pursue a PHD under them.  

**START EARLY ON ASSIGNMENTS** ‚Äì I can‚Äôt count the number of times starting an assignment early saved my ass.  Starting early gives you time to deal with the unexpected: the family emergencies, the late night hangout with friends, the memory leak on line 74. Procrastination is like playing Russian Roulette with your CS career, don‚Äôt take the chance.

In the quarters where I attended half of the lectures, never read the book, and crammed before due dates and exams, I was averaging a B in my classes. In the quarters where I followed the steps above, I never got a grade lower than an A-.

### Dealing with Bad Professors

During your time in college, you‚Äôre most likely going to have at least one bad professor that might make it worse if you have to go to class. If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs definitely fine to not go to class (as long as it‚Äôs not mandatory). However, if you do decide not to go, you definitely need to make sure you learn the material, so that you won‚Äôt be behind on the coursework and studying for tests. Another thing you should make sure is that you should be doing something productive on the side. If you don‚Äôt go to class and spend the time watching Netflix or playing video games, you‚Äôre losing time that you can spend on something that might be fun and can help you in the long run.

### You can take Graduate Courses!?
/u/chaitu65c: A highly underutilized set of courses you can take would be graduate courses. Graduate courses are usually very specialized in certain fields. If you were able to take all the undergraduate courses you wanted and still have spare classes to fill out, I would recommend researching into taking Graduate courses! They‚Äôre a good way to build out your specialization and you get to learn really cool stuff! In addition, if you‚Äôre looking for classes to reach the required number of CS courses needed, your CS department might allow you to make the course count towards your degree!

## Projects

### How do I succeed in projects?

**Reading the Project Requirements:** Before starting to code, read the requirements and understand what you need to do in order to finish. Too many students ask for help that can easily be found in the requirements which wastes the student‚Äôs time. 

**Learn to Debug:** Learning how to debug saves you countless hours trying to read through code you might not understand.

[**Learn to write Clean Code**](https://medium.com/mindorks/how-to-write-clean-code-lessons-learnt-from-the-clean-code-robert-c-martin-9ffc7aef870c): With this and being able to debug, you‚Äôre going to be able to write very efficient code and to debug issues easily, thus not making you only successful in lab assignments, but also making you a better programmer.

**Plan your work out:** This allows you to simplify the logic you are writing and this usually leads to clean code.

**Ask for help:** If you ever get stuck on something and no matter how much you Google and you can‚Äôt figure it out, ask for help. It‚Äôs definitely fine to ask for help and is HIGHLY recommended you do so. Take advantage of the lab tutors and TA‚Äôs either through in person or Piazza/Canvas; they‚Äôre there to help you.

**Draw Pictures:** If your project involves multiple things (AWS, Databases, Servers, etc), it‚Äôs definitely a good idea to draw a picture that shows you each thing interacts with and how it comes together. This is important especially when you enter the industry and build software for companies.

### Projects and your CS Career

/u/rishiss: Projects are your saving grace, especially if you are lacking work experience. They show technical aptitude, willingness to take initiative, and leadership. I‚Äôve seen people with only projects on their resume get positions at the Big N. Projects are good ways to expand your knowledge of CS as the possibilities are endless!
It is best to have a variety of projects dealing with a variety of technologies. As such, you can open yourself up to more positions and have more talking points during the interview. I tend to edit the ‚ÄòProject‚Äô Section of my resume with relevant projects and technologies. For instance, if I made a full stack web application and applied to a DevOps organization, I would highlight my AWS, CI/CD, and Terraform experiences more than my React/Node js work. 


### Open Source Contributions

If you‚Äôve ever noticed popular github repositories such as torvalds/linux, these are repositories where people from all over the world can report issues with it and someone can fix it. If you are able to make a contribution to a huge open source repository, it looks really good on your resume.

## Hackathons

### What are Hackathons?

Hackathons are large scale coding events, where students from around the area come together and collaborate - usually in teams of 4 (but you can go solo or with a partner!) - to build some software. Companies like Amazon, Northrop Grumman, Google, and Twilio sponsor awards related to best use of their technology. After 24 - 48 hours of intensive coding(they‚Äôll definitely have the red bull/yerba mate for it), participants submit their projects, whether it be an Android video game, Chrome Extension, productivity web app, etc. Submissions are shared with the companies and other hackathon organizers, where they select the best projects and award teams with swag like keyboards, gift cards, Amazon Echos, and even summer internships at their company. 

Participating in hackathons are one of the best ways to hone your coding skills, network with companies and other students, and get free comfy T-shirts. It is also one of the best ways to gain industry knowledge, as representatives from these companies and hackathon organizers create numerous workshops and answer any questions you may have. Winning awards at these hackathons are also great resume boosters and talking points during interviews. 

The biggest hackathon organizer is [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/). Visit their website, and you can see all the hackathons (remote or local) they are partnered with. Make to be on the lookout for application release dates from the hackathons and apply early.

### What Should I Do At Hacakathons?

Take advantage of the resources available at hackathons. You‚Äôre attending a mini CS conference and should be, besides coding, networking with professionals, learning about the different companies, attending workshops, asking technical/non-technical questions to mentors, and getting as much free shit as you can get. Besides T-Shirts, companies give out vouchers to their services(such as free AWS/Azure/GCP credit!), applications to their internship and full-time positions, pillows, USB drives, socks, pencils/pens, notebooks, water bottles, sweaters, stickers, and even backpacks. 

If you‚Äôre looking to get an award, judges at hackathons care a lot about the pitch and the idea rather than the actual execution of the idea. Having an idea beforehand is also helpful, so you can spend your time focusing on the MVP. 

## Friends and Networking

/u/chaitu65c: I think it‚Äôs definitely useful if you have two different friend groups: One dedicated to career and Non-Career Group.

Career Group - When making a friend group dedicated to career, try to be the dumbest person in the group, you‚Äôre definitely going to learn a lot from them as you soak up knowledge! Best ways of meeting friends who are career-driven can be through major specific orientation (actually how I met /u/rishiss), courses, major related clubs, etc.

Non-Career Group - While having a group that motivates you for your career is important, it‚Äôs also important to have another friend group that can help you relax and to enjoy your time! A really good way to find these friend groups can be anywhere from your hall to General Education courses, social clubs like Circle K, fraternities and sororities(if that‚Äôs your cup of tea) and others! 

## Resume

/u/rishiss: Here are the few take-aways on writing a resume that gets through the ATS.

**Make your resume accomplishment driven, not just a list of your responsibilities** ‚Äì [This guy puts it best](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/) TL;DR: Your bullets should be in the format -> Accomplished X by doing Y as measured by Z.

**Don‚Äôt put school projects that every other CS student in your school has completed.** Recruiters are able to figure it out and will look down upon this a lot, as it shows you‚Äôre not doing anything outside the classroom to forward your career. Capstone projects are perfectly okay.

**Make it a simple, one-column that recruiters can easily read through.** There‚Äôs a lot of fancy, custom Adobe Resumes out there that the ATS can‚Äôt parse well. There‚Äôs no need for pictures, graphics, colors, fonts, etc.

**Exceptions:** The company you are applying for is small, you‚Äôre going to a career fair and you know your resume will be hand-read, you‚Äôre a UI/UX person or a Graphic Designer

Keep it simple; the content should be carrying you.

**Have at least 3 minimum (I aim for 4-5) per work experience/project**; it makes no sense when you have such amazing experience and only put two bullets.

**If you have a GPA lower than a 3.0, do not bother keeping it on the resume.** If you have a 3.5 +, make sure to keep it.
 
**Make formatting consistent.** This should be a no brainer, but I still see folks‚Äô resume with different fonts, spacing, etc. It‚Äôs annoying; don‚Äôt do it.

**Focus on individual contributions and leadership, not the team.** Recruiters are looking for self-starters and leaders that can see a project throughout the lifecycle, not just another code monkey.

If something you worked on had impact(reduced company cost by x%, etc), definitely mention it. Recruiters love seeing if your work was able to help someone or a company.
Expect to be tested on anything you put on your resume. If you don‚Äôt think you can answer questions about a skill, tech, or experience on your resume, don‚Äôt bother putting it in.

**Make sure to add these items in your resume:** Name, School, GPA (unless its less than 3.0), Work Experience, Projects, Skills (one line for languages, one line for tools/platforms are what I‚Äôve seen the most), relevant links (GitHub, Website, Portfolio)

**Take out any old or irrelevant experience.** Nobody cares about that Tic Tac Toe game you made in high school.

**Get your resume reviewed multiple times by experienced people in tech.** /r/csMajors and /r/cscareerquestions also has a weekly resume roast thread that you can take advantage of.

## Searching for Internships

Searching for internships in CS is really different and harder from searching for internships in other professions. CS internship interview processes are often longer and much more technical on what you have learned as a CS major. For example, the process for Big Ns and Unicorns usually begins with an Online Assessment (OA) involving multiple choice and coding questions about Data Structures, Algorithms, and Run Time Complexity. After passing this OA, you may be invited to an onsite ‚ÄúPower-Day,‚Äù where interviewees attend 3-4 whiteboard interviews while being grilled on their technical skills and projects (You are often pampered with free travel, food, stipends, etc). 

### How to get the Interview

Besides following resume tips, make sure to apply to as many places as you can. To get our first internships, we recall applying to approximately 250-300 places before we secured our internship plans for that summer. Also, if you do get ghosted, don‚Äôt take it personally, usually, university recruiters often spend so much time reviewing a lot of applications. 

Other precautions to take to get noticed are to try attending career fairs if you can, you might be able to get an interview(worst case, free swag!). Other than that, try reaching out to upperclassmen or friends you know that interned and ask for referrals. It‚Äôs one of the best ways to get noticed!

### What to expect

As part of the interview process, there‚Äôs 4 types of interviews that you should make sure you know.

**Behavioral Interview:** These interviews ask you questions about culture fit such as ‚ÄúWhy are you a good candidate‚Äù and ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you ...‚Äù

**Coding/Technical Interview:** These interviews ask you questions similar to what you see on Leetcode and Hackerrank. These interviews are designed to test your Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge.

**System Design:** System Design involves the interviewer testing your building to design a service/software and test your knowledge of understanding what things to use for the task and how you will integrate them together. You‚Äôre definitely not expected to know this and it‚Äôs not likely you‚Äôre gonna get asked this. Places that could ask you this are Unicorns, Trading Companies and Hedge Funds, and Big Established Companies.

**Concurrency/Low Level Interviews:** If the company‚Äôs biggest product involves low level principles such as networking principles and kernel stuff, there‚Äôs a possibility you can get asked this. Places that come to mind are hardware companies, trading firms, and places where the team you could work on uses these principles.
Some companies may adopt only one of these interviews and some may adopt all. We highly recommend doing some research on Glassdoor and Reddit to gain insight on the interview and possibly know what questions will be asked beforehand. 

### How to Ace the Interview

Once you finish the OA(Online Assessment), a recruiter might reach out to officially start the process. While doing this, it‚Äôs highly recommended that you look up the interview experiences that other students have faced so that you can potentially filter out companies with red flags. Common sources to search up on this would be Reddit (r/csMajors and r/cscareerquestions), Jumpstart (Relatively new portal for students), Glassdoor and maybe Blind (Aside from the toxic TC or GTFO culture, they do give good advice on interviews). With that said, here‚Äôs some advice we have when you approach each kind of interview we‚Äôve seen.

#### Advice on Behavioral Interviews
Use the [STAR method](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629) when describing your experiences. Being quantifiable with the impact of your actions will impress the interviewer. 

#### Advice on Technical Interviews
Begin by reviewing your notes from the Data Structures and Algorithms class. Do not proceed further until you know how to implement these DS and As from scratch with the language of your choice(If you do know python, it‚Äôs recommended as there‚Äôs a lot of builtin features!). After doing so,  we highly recommend a book like CTCI and EPI to gain a review on programming language details and your DS and As. Then, visit sites like LeetCode to practice real questions from major companies. A Facebook Engineer completed 600 LeetCode problems and compiled the most important ones into a [list here](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU). During the interview, make sure to talk out loud about possible approaches and tradeoffs before whiteboarding. It is perfectly acceptable (often recommended) to ask the interviewer to ask questions about the problem and get clarification. Once you have an idea in mind and have talked about it with your interviewer, begin whiteboarding. While you talk about the final idea you want to use, write out pseudo code and comments about all the steps you need to implement in order to finish coding your solution. After that, start coding. Make sure to have proper function headers, syntax, spacing, classes/structs, imports, etc. After coding your solution, give a brief explanation and attempt to make it run with less space and in less time (if your solution is not as efficient as you think it can be). 

#### Advice on System Design
These are somewhat hard to approach if you don‚Äôt have experience ever doing it. If you do have experience designing and building services in your spare time and as part of your work experience, definitely rely on your experience. An important thing is to definitely ask clarifying questions. There might be hidden requirements you didn‚Äôt think about that could drastically change the way you approach the solution.

#### Advice on Concurrency/Low level
Understand basic principles such as Processes vs Threads (A lot of people don‚Äôt know the difference!)TCP vs UDP and how to make an application thread safe(Make sure stuff doesn‚Äôt go haywire when multiple threads access and overwrite something). Other than that, it‚Äôs recommended that you familiarize yourself with basic OS concepts such as Deadlocks, locks that you can utilize to make an application thread safe, etc.

## Searching for Full Time Jobs:

The process for finding a Full-Time Job is usually very similar to finding an Internship. There‚Äôs three main differences are: 

1. **Harder Questions**. Ex: Google usually asks Leetcode Mediums to Hards + the special Leetcode Hard question that Google asks it‚Äôs applicants (they create a new one every year).

2. **More Rounds of Interviewing**: For example, Microsoft makes interns do 2 rounds while New Grads do 4 rounds during the onsite part of the process.

3. **Compensation**: Interns usually get an hourly rate and, possibly, a housing stipedd. New grads, however, are given a yearly salary and, possibly, a sign-on bonus, stocks, and benefits e.g. health insurance, vacation days, etc.

The process for finding a Full-time Job won‚Äôt really change as much as finding an internship, but keep in mind that the bar is higher. This is probably the biggest reason why you should look into interning early; by getting an offer at the place you like, you don‚Äôt necessarily need to go through the daunting process of finding a full-time role unless you want to negotiate for a higher compensation package.

### Negotiation

Negotiation is a really powerful tool that you can use in the interview process, even as an intern. There‚Äôs a lot of guides to negotiation and we recommend Nick Singh‚Äôs guide (Look at his linkedin and newsletters) for more.

## Final Thoughts

University is a probably the most important time of your life and a foundational block of your CS Career. Like any foundation, it must be sturdy and takes a tremendous amount and energy of time to develop. Take advantage of all the resources (like this one) you can get your hands on. Definitely learn from the mistakes people have made and make sure you don‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes.
